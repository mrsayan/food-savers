# Food Savers
This hack was made during Hack The Mountains 2.0 2021.

## Overview
Food Savers is an app designed to reduce food wastage by allowing communities to come together digitally to share food items preventing avoidable food wastage. If you have a food item lying in your fridge that is approaching its expiry date and you are not planning on consuming it, you can list it in the community market where other people can view the item and message you to collect the food item, reducing food wastage and carbon footprint. 

## Motivation
The Food Waste Index Report 2021, from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and partner organisation WRAP, said that around 931 million tonnes of food waste was generated in 2019, sixty-one per cent of which came from households, 26 per cent from food service and 13 per cent from retail. This suggests that 17 per cent of total global food production may be wasted. The weight roughly equals that of 23 million fully loaded 40-tonne trucks - bumper-to-bumper, enough to circle the Earth seven times. In India, the household food waste estimate is 50 kg per capita per year, or 68,760,163 tonnes a year. In India, a lot of food is thrown out on a regular basis at weddings, celebrations, restaurants, and hotels. India, being a poor country, has to cope with difficult conditions in order to satisfy everyone's fundamental needs. On the worldwide hunger and poverty index, India presently ranks 105th out of 117 nations, ranking below all South-East Asian countries.
  
  **Food Savers** as a project aims to aid the project by providing a way to reduce the food wastage. The app allows user to add food and information about the food such as expiry date into the virtual fridge by taking a picture. If the food is approaching expiry date, the user can choose to put the item onto community market where other users are able to view the item and message the user to arrange pickup. This way a food item can be shared amongst the community market which could reduce the avoidable food waste. 

### Target
Our solution will help households to prevent food waste by implementing two strategies. We will remind people about the food they have stored and when it will go out of date and by making it easy for people to give away food that they will not be able to use and would usually throw away.
Our app will therefore focus on the prevention of food waste and redistribution of food.

## Future Scope
- Allow partial food ordering for NGOs.
- Send real time notifications to hotels and NGOs whenever there's a food order placed, or when excess food is advertised.
- Adding a food estimator feature, which will enable hotels and restaurants to predict how much food they need to make based on previous data of food generated and wasted.
